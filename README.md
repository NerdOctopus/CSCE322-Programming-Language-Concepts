# CSCE322-Programming-Language-Concepts
Homework that I completed for Ryan Patrick's Programming Language Concepts class at UNL

There were four programming assignments for this class which explored different strategies and idiosyncracies of different languages.
The assignments were for Antlr, Javascript, Haskell and Prolog (in that order).

To view my work, open the "starter" folder of the relevant assignment, there you will find the final files that I submitted.
The PDFs included in each starter folder describe the tasks that I had to complete for each assignment.

This repository is for the benefit of any potential employers and those who wish to see examples of these languages.
Any use of it to complete schoolwork is plagiarism and of course, expressly forbidden.
